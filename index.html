	    	  He reigns from heaven above<br>
	    	  With wisdom, power, and love<br>

		      And if You are for me, who can be against me? Yeah <br>
			  For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for You<br>
 			  When all I see are the ashes, You see the beauty<br>
			  Thank You God<br>
			  When all I see is a cross, God, You see the empty tomb<br><br>
	   	  	  <!--3-->
	   	  	  Every time I tried to make it on my own<br>
			  Every time I tried to stand and start to fall<br>
			  And all those lonely roads that I have travelled on<br>
  			  There was God<br><br>
	     	  <!--4-->
	    	  There's joy in the house of the Lord<br>
  			  There's joy in the house of the Lord today<br>
			  And we won't be quiet<br>
			  We shout out Your praise<br><br>
	     	  <!--5-->
	     	  Just ask the waves
			  If they are stilled at the mention of His name<br>
			  They'll say my God is still the same<br>
			  Ask the walls<br>
			  If they still fall at the mighty sound of praise<br>
			  They'll say my God is still the same<br><br>
	    	  <!--6-->
	   	   	  The only scars in Heaven, they won't belong to me and you<br>
			  There'll be no such thing as broken, and all the old will be made new<br>
			  And the thought that makes me smile now, even as the tears fall down<br>
			  Is that the only scars in Heaven are on the hands that hold you now<br><br>
